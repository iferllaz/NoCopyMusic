# NoCopyMusic - Your Creative Hub

## Overview

I'm excited to introduce NoCopyMusic, a dedicated platform for artists and creators like me to freely share and download music, videos, and images without the worry of copyright constraints. It's a space where anyone can unleash their creativity and connect with like-minded individuals.

## Technologies Utilized

- PHP
- HTML
- CSS
- MongoDB

## Project Description

I created NoCopyMusic as a school project to provide a platform for artists to share their talent and creative art. While I built the platform using PHP, HTML, and CSS, please be aware that I encountered compatibility challenges in connecting PHP to MongoDB, which remained unresolved during development. Nevertheless, it can be adjusted to SQL databases without problem.

## How to Contribute

If you're interested in contributing to NoCopyMusic, feel free to:

1. Tackle the PHP to MongoDB compatibility issue or propose enhancements.
2. Submit a pull request to merge your modifications into the project.

## Disclaimer

I'd like to emphasize that the project could not succesfully get to work correctly due to some compatibility challenges, but I'm sharing it with the intention of serving as a resource of learning from the errors I encountered during my learning process. However, despite the obstacles I issued, it stands as a testament to my learning journey.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to NoCopyMusic. Your contributions could help make this platform a comfortable space for creative artists.
